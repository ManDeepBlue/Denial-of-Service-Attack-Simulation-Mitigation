# Denial-of-Service-Attack-Simulation-Mitigatio
This project demonstrates a controlled Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack simulation in a virtual lab using Kali Linux and Windows 7, applying the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) methodology.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Target:** Windows 7 VM
- **Attacker:** Kali Linux VM
- **Attack Types:** TCP SYN Flood, UDP Flood
- **Tools Used:** hping3, Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap, Apache
- **Framework:** PTES (Pre-engagement ‚Üí Intelligence Gathering ‚Üí Exploitation ‚Üí Post-exploitation)

## üß™ Key Features

- Performed SYN flood via `hping3` to exhaust SSH port resources.
- Analyzed impact via Wireshark and CPU usage tracking.
- Created and sent a simulated backdoor using `msfvenom` and phishing.
- Gained remote control using `Meterpreter` in Metasploit.
- Applied mitigations: SYN cookies, rate limiting, IDS/IPS.

## üõ°Ô∏è Defense Techniques Tested

- SYN Cookies
- TCP Intercept
- uRPF (Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding)
- AI-based Anomaly Detection
- Web Application Firewalls
